<i>Mostly writing, sometimes coding.</i> <br><br>

👋 Hi there! I'm Anmol - a technical writer obsessed with writing valuable stuff for the developer community.

Worked with a lot of funded startups (including YC-backed), some valued at over `$50M` and reached a combined audience of `1.8M+ audience` combined on [dev.to/anmolbaranwal](https://dev.to/anmolbaranwal) (primary) and [medium.com/@anmolbaranwal](https://medium.com/@anmolbaranwal).

A little more about me:

- Graduated in 2024 with 100% scholarship in CS
- Been featured 4x as a Top Author on Devto
- My [open source guide](https://dev.to/anmolbaranwal/a-complete-guide-to-open-source-100x-simpler-2d6c) was picked by official GitHub community
- Runs my [OpenSouls discord community](https://dub.sh/opensouls) of 400+ members (best place to talk to me).
- At some point in my journey, I have done UX designing, research, software development, content writing and more.
- Check all the details at [anmolbaranwal.com](https://anmolbaranwal.com/)!

💜 I have spent around 2 years in open source. Contributed to many open source projects, joined 600+ discussions and earned a lot of reputation. Love the ecosystem.

I code for fun and keep learning new stuff :)
